# Music Player
 
# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from my enjoyment of using Spotify and appreciating its user interface and functionalities. I'm usually listening to music on Spotify and have always found the user interface and functionalities such as shuffling playlists, skipping songs, playing/pausing songs, and adjusting a song's progress bar very interesting. Thus, I decided to explore the magic behind Spotify myself by creating my very own music player application! 

# Overview
The purpose of this application is to mimic the interface and functionality of music playing on Spotify and to enable users to play their favourite songs on a simple interface and with several music playing features. This application implements play/pause, shuffle, repeat, loop, play next, play previous, and progress bar functionality. It plays songs that are downloaded and placed into the subfolder "Songs" and an image associated with the song is displayed if the image exists in the subfolder "Song_Images".
